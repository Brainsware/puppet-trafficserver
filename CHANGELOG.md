# 2016-12-03 Releasing v1.0.0

This took longer than expected.

After polishing the types branch that has been sitting around for close to a
year, I've now added tests and updated the documentation.

We've caught up to Voxpupuli's modulesync and Travis Release process.

Unsurprisingly, for this module perhaps, this marks another release before a
breaking release: v2.0.0 will be dropping puppet 3.x support.

# 2015-10-20 Releasing v0.2.3

* Releasing current master, as-is, before we release our types branch as
  version 1.0.0
