# 2016-12-05 Releasing v1.0.6

Add support for *restarting* Trafficserver 7.x. This version of Trafficserver
removed the `traffic_line` utility. So in this release of
`brainsware-trafficserver`, notifies the service class to reload the service.

# 2016-12-04 Releasing v1.0.5

Add support for Trafficserver 7.x. This version of Trafficserver removed the
`traffic_line` utility. So in this release of `brainsware-trafficserver`, we
add support for `traffic_ctl`.

# 2016-12-03 Releasing v1.0.4

This took longer than expected.

After polishing the types branch that has been sitting around for close to a
year, I've now added tests and updated the documentation.

We've caught up to Voxpupuli's modulesync and Travis Release process.
The latter was more painful than anticipatedâ€¦

Unsurprisingly, for this module perhaps, this marks another release before a
breaking release: v2.0.0 will be dropping puppet 3.x support.

# 2015-10-20 Releasing v0.2.3

* Releasing current master, as-is, before we release our types branch as
  version 1.0.0
